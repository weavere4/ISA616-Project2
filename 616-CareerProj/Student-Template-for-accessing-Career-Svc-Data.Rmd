# Description of the Audience and Purpose of your Project

Our audience is Michelle Chevalier, the Farmer School of Business Director of Industry Partnerships. In the Farmer School of Business, a large emphasis is put on students getting jobs in "The Four C's" - Cincinnati, Columbus, Cleveland, and Chicago. Through our analysis, we want to see if students are getting a lot of jobs outside of the 4 C's. If we find that this is the case, this will change Michelle's role. She will expand her corporate partnership outside the 4 C's and try to connect with companies in other populated cities with Miami graduates. Once she determines which states are the most popular outside of the 4 C's, she will try to get some of these companies to come to career fair, have a presence on Handshake, and network with students. This project will help students who do not want to work in the 4 C's and help FSB faculty to provide company partnerships where there is student need.

# Introduction and Purpose

We took on the first prompt "Geographic trends". We are trying to predict where students might want to move in the future based on where students have gone in the past based on graduates from 2019 to 2021. We will look at the value counts of each state to determine where most students are going. In order to create these insights, we will need to create a chloropleth. Our product will be intuitive for users of any background to understand. Our goal is to use the past data to create insights that can be applied to future graduating classes and have stronger prediction abilities.

# Data Sources

**Description of the Data**

This data was entered by students, meaning that there are many inconsistencies with the way that the data was entered. For example, for job location of Cincinnati, the students could enter "Cincinnati, OH" or "cincinnati" or "Cincinnati, OH, USA". There are several variables that are incorrectly coded like year, gender, GPA range, race, survey_pref, location_pref, field_pref. In order to get meaning from these variables, they need to be manipulated before analyzing. There are 3235 total observations in the dataset. 

You have three years of data representing FSB graduates, including graduates in 2019, 2020, and 2021. The dataset provided had 42 variables. The source is either derived by me during data cleaning/merging, from the Oracle Business Intelligence Enterprise Edition (OBIEE) maintained by Miami adminsitration, or from the self reported senior survey. I have cleaned and merged the files into one file.

Utilizing the mapping lists and tidyverse code to mutate, standardize, and clean the data

```{r}

  #formalizing the state column to be standardized
  mutate(survey_state = ifelse(tolower(survey_state) %in% names(state_mapping), state_mapping[tolower(survey_state)], survey_state)) %>% 
  # mutating all values that point to uncertainty or not knowing to be a single column called undecided
  mutate(survey_gradschool = ifelse(survey_gradschool %in% undecided_values, "Undecided", survey_gradschool)) %>%
  # Map the city column the same way as the state column
  mutate(survey_city = ifelse(survey_city %in% names(city_mapping), city_mapping[(survey_city)], survey_city)) %>% 
  #Getting rid of values that are not condusive with the column and making it an integer
  mutate(survey_offers = ifelse(survey_offers %in% c("multiple", "an","2+"), NA, as.integer(survey_offers))) %>%

#Summary statistics to get an easy overview of what the data looks like now

print(summary_data)
```

In our data cleaning process, we tackled various tasks to ensure our dataset was accurate and ready for analysis. One of the key aspects we addressed was the standardization of location data, particularly the 'survey_state' and 'survey_city' columns. We observed that there were issues like misspelled entries, inconsistent capitalization, or different formats used to represent the same places. To effectively understand where students are moving and seeking jobs, we needed a clean and uniform representation of these locations.

To achieve this, we developed a mapping list and applied it to correct all non-standard values. This made all entries consistent and allowed for easier analysis.

We applied a similar approach to the 'grad school' column, where we noticed multiple answers referencing 'undecided.' We standardized these entries to create a more consistent dataset.

For the 'internships' and 'offers' columns, we transformed the data into numeric values to ensure the correct data type. During this process, any values that were not numeric or were ambiguous were converted to 'n/a' to maintain data integrity.

Next, we reviewed the data types of various columns, such as 'latin_honors', 'years', 'gender', 'Race', 'survey_plans' ,'pref_field', and 'pref_loc'. We adjusted them to the appropriate data types to ensure accurate analysis. For most of the columns we transformed them to factors to allow for analyses on the categorical variable. 

Finally, we removed certain columns, namely 'BBRJ,' 'study abroad courtesy account,' and 'transfer work.' These columns were deemed to have no meaningful value according to the documentation and were therefore eliminated from our dataset.
